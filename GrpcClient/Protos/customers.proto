// Note: Remember to setup this as Client Only and set the build action to Protobuf Compiler in the file properties
// In addition, remember to rebuild the server to get the built file it is needed


//This file should be in sync with the one on the server. 
//The best approach would be to put this in a common directory so we don't need to copy and paste.
